-- | Carriers for semiring-weighted parsing, wired into the 'numhask'
-- hierarchy.
--
-- The semiring classes themselves live in 'NumHask.Algebra.Ring' and
-- 'NumHask.Algebra.Additive' / 'Multiplicative'.  This module supplies the
-- carriers that do not already have a home in 'NumHask.Free.Carriers' and
-- re-exports the off-the-shelf carriers we need.
